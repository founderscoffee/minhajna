# Contributing to Minhajna

<!-- djazairdev-template: 1.5.2 -->

## What we accept now

The project is at stage 1 of its opening plan ([PRD §1.13](docs/prd/PRD.md#113-opening-in-stages)). We accept:
- feedback and suggestions;
- corrections to annual plans and other reference data;
- print templates and layouts;
- translations.

Code contributions are by invitation until the launch, planned for September 2027. If you'd like to help with code, open an issue and introduce yourself.

**A first contribution** starts with an issue labelled [good first issue](https://github.com/djazairdev/minhajna/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22): comment on it to say you're working on it, and follow [Content contributions](#content-contributions) below.

## Never post real pupil data

Never post pupils' names, marks, absences or photos anywhere in the project: not in issues, pull requests, screenshots, videos, test data or messages. Use made-up names.

Why:
- **Civil-service secrecy** covers pupils' marks and attendance (Ord. 06-03 Art. 48).
- **Transfer abroad.** Publishing personal data through a platform run from abroad, such as GitHub, counts as a transfer abroad under ANPDP deliberation 04.

Maintainers remove any post with real pupil data as soon as they see it, and tell its author privately why.

## Report security problems privately

Never report a security problem in a public issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Content contributions

Each correction or template must state:
- **its source:** an official text, an inspector's distribution, or your own work;
- **where it applies:** the level, subject and school year.

By contributing content, you agree to publish it under CC BY-SA 4.0. Tell us how you'd like to be credited, or whether you'd rather not be.

## Code contributions (by invitation, for now)

Read the [contributor handbook](#the-contributor-handbook) before your first pull request. The essentials:
- **Licence.** Code is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- **Sign-off.** Sign off every commit under the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/) with `git commit -s`. The sign-off certifies that you have the right to submit the work under the project's licence. A GitHub no-reply email address is fine.
- **Copyright.** There is no CLA: you keep the copyright in your contribution.
- **Commit messages** follow [Conventional Commits](docs/contributing/commits.md), for example `fix(export): leave locked cells untouched in the grade workbook`.
- **AI-assisted work** is welcome, on the terms in [AI-assisted contributions](#ai-assisted-contributions).
- **Privacy-sensitive changes** get extra review ([PRD §1.7](docs/prd/PRD.md#17-contributions)). These are changes that touch:
  - network calls;
  - encryption;
  - sync;
  - insights;
  - the export of marks;
  - anything that reads or writes the school's official files.

### Set up and run the checks

You need Node.js 22.18 or later. The same commands CI runs on every pull request:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djazairdev/minhajna
cd minhajna
npm ci --no-audit
(cd apps/android && npm ci --no-audit)
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```

The Android build has its own checks: [docs/checks/android-build.md](docs/checks/android-build.md). Pull requests also check the sign-off, the licence of every file, the title, secrets, and the licences and vulnerabilities of new dependencies ([workflow.md](docs/contributing/workflow.md#pull-requests)).

## AI-assisted contributions

You're welcome to use AI coding tools, on these terms ([PRD §1.7](docs/prd/PRD.md#17-contributions)):

- **You are the author.** Understand every line you submit, and be ready to explain it in review. "The model wrote it" doesn't answer a review comment.
- **Say so,** in the pull request, and with an `Assisted-by:` or `Co-authored-by:` trailer when a tool wrote a substantial part ([commits.md](docs/contributing/commits.md#ai-assisted-work)). Your sign-off is yours alone.
- **Run the checks yourself,** and report the results you actually got.
- **Point your agent at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).** Most coding agents read it on their own, and its rules bind them as they bind you.
- **No autonomous agents.** A person writes or reviews every issue, pull request and comment; an agent may not open them on its own.
- **Check what a tool finds** before you report it, and report security problems privately. An unchecked report is closed.
- **Never give an AI tool pupil data, secrets or an unpublished security report** (principle 2).
- Maintainers may close a low-effort generated pull request or issue without a detailed review.

## Review

- A maintainer reviews every pull request, as [workflow.md](docs/contributing/workflow.md#review) describes; we may ask for changes, which is normal.
- **CI on a pull request from a fork waits until a maintainer approves the run.** That's a safety setting, not a judgement on your change.
- Answer review comments with new commits rather than a force-push, so the conversation stays readable. The squash merge tidies the history.
- Nothing is closed automatically. If a pull request goes quiet for a long time, we ask before we close it.

## Our pledge

The maintainers reply to every newcomer's pull request within 7 days, even if only to say when we'll review it.

## The contributor handbook

| Guide | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Workflow](docs/contributing/workflow.md) | Issues, branches, pull requests, review, merging and decision records |
| [Commit messages](docs/contributing/commits.md) | The commit format, the sign-off and AI-assisted work |
| [Versions](docs/contributing/versioning.md) | How the apps, the server, the file formats, the database and the reference data are versioned |
| [Releases](docs/contributing/releases.md) | The release calendar, the release checks, signing and the changelog |
| [Engineering rules](docs/contributing/engineering.md) | The rules every code change follows: privacy, secrets, test data, tests, dependencies and licences |

Some tools the handbook mentions, such as the automated checks, `CHANGELOG.md` and `NETWORK.md`, arrive with the first code. Until then, its rules apply to the documents wherever they can.

How the project decides, and the teacher council's part in it, are in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Language

- **With teachers:** Arabic.
- **Code, commits and developer documents:** English, with Arabic summaries of anything teachers need to know.

## Conduct

Be respectful. Don't harass anyone or make personal attacks.

The project's spaces stay about the product. That means no political or union campaigning, and no attacks on named people, whether officials, colleagues, pupils or parents.

The full rules, and how to report a problem privately, are in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
