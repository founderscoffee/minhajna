# Screen map

Every screen of Minhajna's design, with the PRD sections and requirements it implements. An implementation ticket names its screen by the **screen ID** and cites the requirement IDs it must meet, defined in [requirements.md](requirements.md). Each ID links to the screen as an image; the HTML beside it carries the exact wording and styles.

- **The PRD:** [docs/prd/PRD.md](../prd/PRD.md). When a screen and the PRD disagree, the PRD wins.
- **The design system:** [system/](system/brand.md): tokens, components and the logo. Each component lists the screens that use it.
- All names and entries on the screens are made up.

**Stage** proposes when each screen is built, from PRD §2.5 and §10.1:
- *Field check:* the prototype of setup, Today and roll call.
- *Pilot:* the rest of the teacher app and reader mode.
- *Launch:* the timetable package, handover, sync and the yearly cycle.
- *Insights:* 2027/28.
- *National:* after the Ministry adopts Minhajna.
- *Curators:* the pack editor.

## Is every teacher screen designed?

Yes, except 1 requirement partly designed: R-6.2-02 (Privacy still shows a placeholder for the data-protection contact: the PRD does not name it). Of the 575 teacher-facing requirements in the PRD, 539 are designed, 1 partly, 0 have no screen, and 35 are rules with no screen of their own. The contradictions with the PRD and the screens to add or change are listed under "What is missing or wrong" in [requirements.md](requirements.md).

| Scope | PRD | Requirements | Designed | Partial | Missing | Rule only |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. Getting started, Today and roll call | §2.3, §2.5–2.6, §3.1–3.4 | 164 | 156 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| B. Marks, documents, digest, sharing and the pilot | §3.5–3.11, §9.3, §10.3 | 158 | 147 | 0 | 0 | 11 |
| C. Plan packs, the calendar and the engine | §4 (teacher-facing parts) | 106 | 102 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| D. Data, privacy, security and the school space | §1.5–1.6, §1.11, §5.5, §5.7–5.9, §6.2, §6.4–6.6, §6.8, §7 (teacher parts), §8.4 | 147 | 134 | 1 | 0 | 12 |
