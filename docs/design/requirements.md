# Requirements and their screens

Every teacher-facing requirement of the PRD, one line each, with the screens that meet it and what is still missing. IDs are `R-<PRD section>-<number>`. Line numbers in the PRD column refer to [`docs/prd/PRD.md`](../prd/PRD.md) as of 4 Oct 2026. Coverage: *designed*, *partial*, *missing*, or *n/a (rule)* for a rule that needs no screen of its own.

| R-4.2-02 | Show each item's kind (closed list), essential or optional flag, stage template, textbook page and source page | §4.2 (1139–1149, 1158–1161) | Plan-item (badges «مورد» «أساسي», stages, «المخطط السنوي، الصفحة 4 · الكتاب المدرسي، الصفحة 24»); Plan (row tags «تشخيصي» «احتياط» «ثابت»); Catchup (an optional item) | designed | — |

| R-4.2-06 | An item without a stage template is tracked as "in progress / done", plus the sessions spent | §4.2 (1159); §4.7 (1312) | Sheet-nostage, Plan-free | designed | — |
| R-4.2-07 | Tests and exams are not pack items: the calendar places them and they reduce the sessions available | §4.2 (1163) | Plan (rows «الفرض · ثابت», «اختبارات الفصل الأول · ثابت · تقديري»); Setup-7-Ready («بعد الفرض»); Calendar | designed | — |
| R-4.2-08 | Every pack shows its status: Official, In force, Latest found, Stale or Community | §4.2 (1165–1173) | Setup-6-Plan (badge «أحدث طبعة متوفرة»), Settings-two-schools | designed | — |

| R-4.2-17 | On a move, the migration entries carry every layer's operations on the device: a renamed item keeps them; a split or merged item carries them when clear; skipping a split item skips every part; an item added after it comes after the last part | §4.2 (1188–1190) | E-Release (curators' note: «عملية «ترك 1.4.5» في طبقة أستاذ أو مؤسسة تصبح «ترك 1.4.6 و1.4.7»»); Pack-release (results per class) | n/a (rule) | — |
| R-4.2-18 | When the meaning is not clear, the app asks the teacher before the move, never guesses, and keeps the answer in the teacher's own layer | §4.2 (1191); §4.12 (1405) | Pack-release (card «سؤال قبل نقل 4م3», three options, move button «الجواب أولاً» until answered, «يُحفظ الجواب في طبقة تغييراتك، ويمكن تغييره لاحقاً من صفحة العنصر») | designed | — |
| R-4.2-19 | A variant is never labelled official | §4.2 (1192) | none (no variant is drawn) | n/a (rule) | Nothing contradicts it. The district and school layer screens, once drawn, must carry a "not official" label |
| R-4.2-20 | Without a pack, the teacher types their own list of items, and it works like a pack | §4.2 (1196); §3.2 (805) | Plan-free (title, kind, session count, list, «فيعمل السجل كما مع الحزمة: يُقترح في كل حصة العنصر التالي»); Plan (row «مادة دون حزمة: كتابة العناصر») | designed | — |
