# The shared core

The core holds the rules that both apps run: the records and their history, the record layers, the calendar, the lesson engine and roll call ([PRD §5.2](../../docs/prd/PRD.md#52-architecture)). It has no platform code. Each app passes in its own storage, hashing and source of random bytes, so the Android app and the web app give the same results.

It is the first part of the field-check prototype: setup, Today and roll call ([PRD §10.1](../../docs/prd/PRD.md#101-the-roadmap)).

## What is here

| Module | What it does | PRD |
|---|---|---|
| `day.ts` | Calendar days, without clock times | §5.5 |
| `history.ts` | The history: only ever added to, with real deletion. It is chained, so an edit, a deletion or a reordering made without recomputing the chain shows, and a history that does not verify is never opened | §5.5 |
| `layers.ts` | The record layers, and the routes each layer may travel. Only the teacher's own routes take history entries | §5.4 |
| `state.ts` | The events the teacher records, each in one layer, and the state built from them. Routes that leave the teacher take the current version of each record, never the day it was made. Erasure takes whole records | §5.3, §5.4, §7.6 |
| `reference.ts`, `pack.ts` | Reference data: the country profile, the school year, the calendar and plan packs, which are checked when read | §4.2, §4.5, §5.9 |
| `calendar.ts`, `sessions.ts` | Teaching weeks, A/B weeks, and each class's dated sessions. A later timetable applies from the day it was recorded, and the teacher's own calendar marks only the teacher's sessions | §4.5, §4.6 |
| `engine.ts` | Proposals, progress by stages, each stage kept on its own, and the six session outcomes | §3.3, §4.7 |
| `today.ts` | The Today screen, and confirming a whole day or week at once | §3.3 |
| `pacing.ts` | Delay in sessions, sessions lost to the calendar, buffers and the September check. Sessions lost to the teacher's own calendar are counted apart, for the teacher alone | §4.7 |
| `roll-call.ts` | Roll call by half-day or by session, corrections, and the totals for each pupil. Every roll call taken counts, and those the rest of the record leaves out are listed for the teacher | §3.4 |

## Running the tests

The core needs Node.js 22.18 or later, which runs TypeScript directly. It has no runtime dependencies. TypeScript itself is a development dependency of the repository, for the type check only.

```bash
npm test
```

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

The type check covers `src/`. The tests are run, not type-checked, since that needs Node.js's own type definitions.

The test data is made up ([engineering rules](../../docs/contributing/engineering.md#test-data)). The two plan packs in the tests are invented, with the status `example`, and are never published as reference data. Only `data.test.ts` reads real files: Algeria's reference data in [`data/`](../../data/README.md), which it runs made-up classes against.

## Not here yet

- Marks, appreciations and the term export.
- The documents, and the files Minhajna reads and writes, such as the class list and the Minhajna archive.
- Encryption of the stored records, sync, backup and signing. Until entries are signed with the teacher's key, a full rewrite of the history that recomputes every hash goes unseen ([PRD §5.5](../../docs/prd/PRD.md#55-history-corrections-and-signatures)).
- Insights ([PRD §1.6](../../docs/prd/PRD.md#16-anonymous-insights-rules-for-openness)) and totals above the school ([PRD §5.10](../../docs/prd/PRD.md#510-the-permission-model)). They will carry only figures formed later from the records, never history entries or records, so they are not routes here.
- Multigrade classes, sessions outside the timetable, the teacher's own changes to a plan, and moving a class to a new pack release.
